Welcome to my "User Validator" application !!!

I built this application to consolidate my React skills on building User Forms logic.
A modal popup will appear as a validation for the present forms.
The client can add a single user each time which will be later listed below the form.

This could be integrated in future projects.

Check out the custom favicon ðŸ˜‰

Here you can see my project in action: https://user-validator-application.netlify.app/

Hope you enjoy !!!
